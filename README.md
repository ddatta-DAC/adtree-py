## Introduction for Record, AD-Tree and Contingency Table modules #

When using this package, each of “Record”, “ADTree” and “ContingencyTable” modules must be imported to program. However, there are more than one implementations for each of these three modules. As a result, please consider which implementations is more appropriate before importing.
Note: The name of the folder where all python files are, must not be “adtree” or “ADTree”, since some AD-Tree modules are imported as this name. A folder with name of “adtree” or “ADTree” will cause this package does not work.
